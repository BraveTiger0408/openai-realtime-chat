I can make achievement.


If you can’t find the Achievements section on your GitHub profile, it may be because GitHub’s achievements feature is not yet enabled for your account or you haven’t unlocked any achievements yet. Here’s what to check:

#1. Check if Achievements are Enabled
Achievements are automatically available for most GitHub users. However, if they are not visible:
Ensure your profile is public, as achievements may not show on private profiles.
Try accessing your profile from a different browser or while logged out to confirm visibility.
#2. How to Confirm Achievements
Achievements are part of your GitHub profile page. If you’ve unlocked any, they should appear automatically under your profile. You can also directly verify the Pair Extraordinaire badge by navigating to:
https://github.com/achievements
If the page says you don’t have any achievements yet, you may not have completed a qualifying action.

#3. Possible Reasons You Can’t See Achievements
No Achievements Yet: If you haven’t unlocked any achievements (e.g., Pair Extraordinaire, Starstruck), the section might not appear.
GitHub Account Settings: Some accounts might not display the achievements section if there are profile restrictions or settings affecting visibility.
GitHub Feature Rollout: Achievements might not yet be available for all regions or accounts, though this is rare.
#4. What to Do Next
Double-Check Contributions: Ensure both accounts contributed meaningfully to the pull request in a public repository and wait up to 24 hours for the badge to appear.
Contact GitHub Support: If you’re sure you’ve met all requirements, you can reach out to GitHub Support for clarification:
Visit https://support.github.com and submit a request.
