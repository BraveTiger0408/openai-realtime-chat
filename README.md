I can make achievement.


If you can’t find the Achievements section on your GitHub profile, it may be because GitHub’s achievements feature is not yet enabled for your account or you haven’t unlocked any achievements yet. Here’s what to check:

#1. Check if Achievements are Enabled
Achievements are automatically available for most GitHub users. However, if they are not visible:
Ensure your profile is public, as achievements may not show on private profiles.
Try accessing your profile from a different browser or while logged out to confirm visibility.
#2. How to Confirm Achievements
Achievements are part of your GitHub profile page. If you’ve unlocked any, they should appear automatically under your profile. You can also directly verify the Pair Extraordinaire badge by navigating to:
https://github.com/achievements
If the page says you don’t have any achievements yet, you may not have completed a qualifying action.
